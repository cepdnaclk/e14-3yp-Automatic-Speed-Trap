## Introduction

Nowadays the transpotation is achieving developments in every alongside. Building highways and developing vehicles with new technologies are two side of developments. As a result of that, the vehicles could be achieved more speed than back days and this highspeed might causes unexpected accidents and might damage human life.

So in this project we are expected to track the vehicle speed and if there any vehicle that travelling with more than maximum speed allowed, take a clear photo of the specific vehicle and send that to authorities to take further action.
